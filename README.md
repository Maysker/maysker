### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7oSkaaa/7oSkaaa/refs/heads/main/Images/about_me.gif" width="32" alt="Coder waving" /> Hi there, I'm Adam Gazdiev
Full Stack Developer · Software Architect · System Thinker

I build scalable software systems with a strong focus on backend logic, architecture, and long-term maintainability.  
My workflow merges precision in implementation with a strategic understanding of how software fits into broader business goals.  
I care about clarity, security, modularity — and systems that grow without breaking.

That informs how I think about resilience, systems, and structure — from memory to mechanism.  
I'm Ingush — and I think like an engineer by blood. Like the towers of my ancestors, I craft structures that endure — grounded in clarity, built for complexity.

Based in Belgium 🇧🇪 Born in Ingushetia <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Flag_of_Ingushetia.svg" width="25" alt="Ingushetia Flag"/> 

🛠️ Specializing in system architecture, backend infrastructure, and cross-platform integration.

📁 Note: Most of my current work is private or hosted on Bitbucket (not reflected here on GitHub).
